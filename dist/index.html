          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Dev-Libs is a web & mobile application that was engineered specifically for developers. We wanted to create
            an application that could help lighten the mood at a moment's notice, and to provide a place where
            developers can enjoy libs created with their unique and specific sense of humor, and thus Dev-Libs was
            created.

          <h2>How it works?</h2>
          <p>
            Users fill in fields based on the requested word types, which are then plugged into an existing lib puzzle.
            The application will then generate a story based on the user's input, mixed with a random lib puzzle to
            create a funny story.

            Users can choose puzzles from a variety of categories and languages to add and edit from their account. Once
            a puzzle has been completed, they will also have the ability to share it on social media. We are also
            working on giving the user templates for libs, themed libs and selectable language categories.

          <p>
            Dev-Libs gives developers a source of libs designed specifically for them. Not only can developers come here
            for a quick laugh, they can also create puzzles for other devs to enjoy. If a user finds that they are
            having problems or would like to report a bug, they can easily submit them on the bugs page.

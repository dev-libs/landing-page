          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Dev-Libs is a web & mobile application that was engineered for developers. We wanted to create an
            application that would help lighten the mood at any given time and it had to appeal to developers. We wanted
            to provide a place where developers can enjoy libs created by developers. As developers we have our own
            unique sense of humor and thus Dev-Libs was created.

          <h2>How it works?</h2>
          <p>
            Users fill in fields based on the requested word types which are then systematically plugged into an
            existing lib puzzle. The application will then print out a story based on the users input mixed with a
            random lib puzzle to create a funny story. Our libs are specifically aimed towards developers.

          <p>
            Users can add, edit, and remove libs that are connected to their account. They will be able to select from a
            variety of puzzles to complete. Once a puzzle has been completed they will have the ability to save the
            result as well as share it on social media. The users will have the ability to choose from a variety of
            categories and languages for the lib puzzles.

          <p>
            Dev-Libs allows developers a source for libs designed for them. Not only can developers come here for a
            quick laugh, but if they are interested in creating puzzles for other they can quickly submit a lib
            template. If your having problems and would like to report a bug you can quickly submit them on the bugs
            page.

# Dev Libs

## Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
Mood lightener, positive reinforcement

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
It provides random silly humor based on the users input.

- What is the mission statement?
Witty comic relief for developers.

## Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. User can add, edit, and delete libs tied to their account.
2. User can complete libs and read the final result
3. User can post the completed lib to twitter via a share link (be mindful of the character limit for twitter)
4. User is able to access libs by category and has access to all of the libs that users have submitted.

- What features do you wish to put in a future release?
User submitted dev-libs templates.
Color coded dev-libs (Seasonal, Categorized, etc)
Syntax highlighting dev-libs
Language Categories

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Humor

## Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
React, Redux, Node, Express, bCrypt, Knex, Cors, Helmet, Core Data

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No

- Are you required to pay to use the API?
No

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
Uikit.

## For Data Scientists

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

## Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Developers

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
Great idea, needs variety.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
Not yet.

## Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours.Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
